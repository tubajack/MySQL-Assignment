MySQL assignment for the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin. 

In this assignment, I am creating an online store, similar to Amazon using the MySQL database and Node.JS.

## Creating the Application
When I first saw the specifications of the project, I knew that this project was inspired by Amazon.   
The technologies that were used in this project were MySQL for the database and Node.JS.   
To make Node.js sync with MySQL, I had to use the npm MySQL package.   
In addition, to create prompts, I used the inquirer package.
